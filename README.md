# Rupant AI: Multilingual Virtual Lab for Bharat 🧪

**Team Name:** VAD AI  
**Track:** AI for Leaning and developer productivity

---

## 🧐 Problem Statement
Over 70% of rural Indian schools lack functional science laboratories. Rupant AI bridges this practical knowledge gap through a multilingual, generative AI virtual lab simulator accessible on low-cost mobile devices.

## 🚀 The Solution
Rupant AI transforms theoretical science into interactive, voice-guided experiments. Using **Amazon Bedrock**, we provide a "Virtual Scientist" that speaks to students in their mother tongue, guiding them through safe chemistry and physics simulations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **AI Engine:** Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- **Voice Services:** Amazon Polly (TTS) & Amazon Transcribe (STT)
- **Backend:** AWS Lambda (Serverless)
- **Frontend:** Python (Streamlit/FastAPI)
- **Storage:** Amazon S3
